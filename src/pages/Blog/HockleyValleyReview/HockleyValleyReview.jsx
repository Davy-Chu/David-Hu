                    This weekend I visited Hockley Valley, a smaller sized ski resort situated a few kilometres north of Orangeville, Ontario. In this article, I will give a comprehensive review of my personal experience at Hockley Valley, and whether or not you should visit as well.

                To begin with, let’s talk about the actual hills at Hockley. I was for the most part, satisfied with the quality of the hills at Hockley. All of the hills were properly maintained, and there was a good amount of variation between the slopes. The lines for the lifts were virtually non-existent, which is surprising as I went on a sunday afternoon, which was pleasant. One qualm I had about the hills was that as a smaller resort, they were on the shorter side, comparable to resorts like Snow Valley and Glen Eden. The resort consists of 2 main ski lifts, and 2 other mini-lifts for the 2 bunny hills. The shorter length of the hills resulted in them being easier than what their grades would suggest. For example, while the black diamonds at Hockley had a similar steepness to that of larger ski resorts like Blue Mountain, their short lengths made them much easier than Blue Mountain blacks. Furthermore, when I visited, half of the black diamonds and the singular double black diamond were closed off. As a result, a more advanced skier/boarder may find themselves weary of the hills after only a few hours. Another personal issue I had with the slopes at Hockley was that there was a lack of any jumps/terrain parks. A staple of most ski resorts is a hill designated as a terrain park, a place for more adventurous skiers/boarders to practice their tricks on various obstacles, such as ramps, pipes, rails, and boxes. At Hockley, they had a hill designated as “freestyle terrain” however it only consisted of an open ski hill, with no props to practice tricks on. There were no ramps or moguls on any of the other hills either at the resort. Despite this, beginners may find more interest in Hockley, as on the singular green circle hill, there are a variety of small objects such as a tunnel and quarter pipe.

                    When it comes to the Hockley Valley resort itself, it offers a variety of amenities. There is only 1 Chalet located besides the main ski lift, however it is large enough to accommodate the many visitors and has a cozy atmosphere. Additionally, the Chalet is connected to the hotel, which offers additional space. There was a surprisingly large variety of food options at the Chalet, with traditional options like cheeseburgers and chicken strips, but also more ethnic options like butter chicken and paninis. I got the buffalo chicken poutine, which exceeded my expectations. It was only 11.50, and I got a regular sized portion and it tasted delicious, which was unexpected, as normally ski resort food is rather overpriced.                 </p>
